 Boston, MA 
 https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=4dcc1374994ed1b4&fccid=95485c6456ed2114&vjs=3 
 Who We Are

The B2B Insights & Analytics team exists to drive optimal decision-making that improves our business customersâ€™ FF&E shopping experience through Sales interactions. We seek to optimize Sales incrementality by identifying the most CLV-accretive Sales interactions with customers, as a critical driver of our flywheel. The data represents the voice of external customers (e.g. onsite activity, communication with Business accounts, orders, & firmographic data) and internal customers (e.g. onsite activity, communication between Sales representatives & Business accounts, CRM, and Sales Operations data). We source, interpret, and translate that voice into actions that serves our customers. Our team leads measurement - particularly around causal inference - and also plays a data challenger role to ensure the STO understands the â€œwhyâ€ behind great customer experiences. We also partner closely with Data Science to jointly develop and apply machine learning approaches to drive growth, as well as with Data Solutions/Engineering, to ensure we have a strong, and high-velocity data foundation.

The team identifies opportunities and provides actionable recommendations based on hard data to grow revenue and improve efficiency. We strive to deliver better understanding of customers and improve the engagement model between Sales and customers.

We expect team members and management to take a high degree of ownership for their areas of focus, and execute on ideas and deliver results under fast-paced cultures. Beyond a strong academic background, a successful candidate will have experience successfully designing and launching A/B testing, measuring impact for unbalanced or skewed data sets, building models and/or creatively leveraging model outputs to improve the existing Sales program structures or Sales engagement models. We are looking for someone who is a self-starter, who approaches complex business questions with data and curiosity, who dives below the surface to identify the causal relationship rather than just trends, and who works effectively with technical and non-technical cross-functional teams.

What Youâ€™ll Do
Owns the end-to-end roadmap and product development process for work impacting a material piece of a customer experience or customer-facing platform (internal or external); soliciting and prioritizing ideas with stakeholders based on the potential impact for customers and the level of effort required for implementation.
Take a leadership role in ensuring we are focused on the most impactful business questions, translate into technical requirements, and determine the appropriate method to deliver high ROI results.
Identify what modeling/analytical approach technique is best suited to answer the questions at hand, making appropriate tradeoffs and pivoting as necessary. Use GBQ, Python/R & Looker to wrangle Wayfairâ€™s unique data to develop hypotheses, experiments and analyses that point to the most significant business growth opportunities.
Identify the relevant software/technology, and build scalable tools that can be used as the foundation for others. Able to incorporate more advanced design elements into visualization/databoards.
Proactively contribute to developing the organization's talent & management (either direct reports or indirectly through cross-functional or project work): do so by offering timely feedback on work product, offer career development advice, or contribute to workstreams to improve talent development within their team/function/etc.
Work closely with Sales, Program Management, Sales Operations, Marketing, Data Solutions, Data Science, Category Management, Finance, Pricing and other teams to develop and execute analyses and tests that lead to accelerating growth.
Communicate findings and recommendations with relevant teams and leadership to drive measurable improvements in Sales incrementality.
Potential Projects

 Our Company


Changing the world through digital experiences is what Adobeâ€™s all about. We give everyoneâ€”from emerging artists to global brandsâ€”everything they need to design and deliver exceptional digital experiences! Weâ€™re passionate about empowering people to create beautiful and powerful images, videos, and apps, and transform how companies interact with customers across every screen.


Weâ€™re on a mission to hire the very best and are committed to creating exceptional employee experiences where everyone is respected and has access to equal opportunity. We realize that new ideas can come from everywhere in the organization, and we know the next big idea could be yours!

The Opportunity
Machine Learning is a critical part of Adobeâ€™s Cloud offering. Adobe Clouds enable customers to build and manage digital content, such as assets, composites, 3D, documents etc., and digital experience and transformations.
Creative Cloud is focused on visual imagination and creation, and includes such well-known products as Photoshop, Illustrator, Lightroom, and Adobe Stock. Document Cloud is centered around the creation and management of textual documents, including Acrobat and Adobe Sign. Experience Cloud is the set of offerings for the large-scale enterprise, covering marketing, advertising, and analytics.
Adobe Sensei powers machine learning and artificial intelligence across all of these Adobe Cloud product lines. This platform enables thousands of applied researchers, millions of users, and billions of content pieces. The objective is to make machine learning offerings a world-class, leading-edge, differentiating product in Adobe Cloud ecosystem. We match the pace, innovation and excitement of a startup, backed by the resources and infrastructure of Adobe!
Data is critical piece of developing machine learning solutions. ML data can include the datasets that train algorithms, but also large-scale evaluation datasets which give insights into algorithm behavior that helps to refine and evolve ML products.
Training data â€“ Adobeâ€™s training datasets often contain digital art, photos, videos, text, or audio files, along with some type of additional knowledge data (user behaviors, annotations, manipulations) to enable meaningful machine learning. How do we build these datasets to maximize performance and accuracy for the customer? How do we ensure that our models are robust and unbiased?
Evaluation - How do we assess the quality of our algorithms and models? What is the ground truth we use to judge them? Where do they succeed and how do they fail? These problems are even more subtle in the complex, creative domains of Adobe products â€“ for example, how should we judge the quality of similarity search, where a user finds new images with an image as the query?
Weâ€™re looking for data scientists to define, drive, and coordinate training data construction and model evaluation for the Applied Machine Learning team at Adobe. This will involve thinking hard about product quality, the role of machine learning in those products, and the capabilities of large-scale human-judgment tasks to support scalable solutions that generate the fuel for success of our AI/ML algorithms.
Responsibilities:
Work closely with product, research, and engineering leaders to understand ML applications and define success.
Interact with APIs to effectively sample raw data to optimize for ML training and evaluation.
Design tasks and guidelines for human judgment jobs to annotate images, videos, text, audio; and also to measure the performance of machine-learned and other advanced algorithms.
Help design A/B tests for our cloud offerings, and use human judgment vs. end-user A/B tests as appropriate
Create a winning culture built on collaboration and shared accomplishments- have fun along the way!
Qualifications:
BS or MS in a technical field (Computer Science, Physics, Math, Statistics) OR in a human-centered field such as Psychology, Linguistics, Human-Computer Interaction.
Exposure to applied machine learning in an enterprise setting.
Proven experience in validation and evaluation of machine learned models.
Strong quantitative and analytical orientation. Experience in evaluation metrics, Python or R, JSON parsing, custom HTML for visualization.
Strong qualitative skillset. Experience in taxonomies, survey design.
Understanding of issues around ground truth and training/evaluation data for ML, including human judgment and A/B testing
Hands-on experience using third-party judgment services such as Figure 8, Appen, or Amazon Mechanical Turk.
At Adobe, you will be immersed in an exceptional work environment that is recognized throughout the world on Best Companies lists . You will also be surrounded by colleagues who are committed to helping each other grow through our unique Check-In approach where ongoing feedback flows freely.
If youâ€™re looking to make an impact, Adobe's the place for you. Discover what our employees are saying about their career experiences on the Adobe Life blog and explore the meaningful benefits we offer.
Adobe is an equal opportunity employer. We welcome and encourage diversity in the workplace regardless of gender, race or color, ethnicity or national origin, age, disability, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or veteran status.",1
