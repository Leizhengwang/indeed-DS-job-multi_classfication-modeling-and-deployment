Research Project: The U.S. Department of Agriculture - Agricultural Research Service (USDA ARS) mission involves problem-solving research in the widely diverse food and agricultural areas encompassing plant production and protection; animal production and protection; natural resources and sustainable agricultural systems; and nutrition; food safety; and quality. The programs are conducted in 46 of the 50 States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. For ARS to maintain its standing as a premier scientific organization, major investments in computing, networking, and storage infrastructure are required. Training in data and information management are integral to the integrity, security, and accessibility of research findings, results, and outcomes within the ARS research enterprise. Nearly 2000 scientists and support staff conduct research within the ARS research enterprise.
The SCINet/Big Data Research Participation Program of the USDA ARS offers research opportunities to motivated postdoctoral fellows interested in working on agricultural- and natural resource-related problems at a range of spatial and temporal scales, from the genome to the continent, and sub-daily to evolutionary time scales. One of the goals of the SCINet Initiative is to develop and apply new technologies, including AI and machine learning, to help solve complex agricultural problems that also depend on collaboration across scientific disciplines and geographic locations. In addition, many of these technologies rely on the synthesis, integration, and analysis of large, diverse datasets that benefit from high performance computers (HPC). The objective of this fellowship is to facilitate cross-disciplinary, cross-location research through collaborative research on problems of interest to each applicant and amenable to or required by the HPC environment. Training will be provided in specific AI, machine learning, deep learning, and statistical software needed for the HPC.
Throughout the course of this research project, the participant will have the opportunity to gain experience in and learn about the challenges associated with managing, coordinating, and training a diverse scientific workforce to access and successfully use high performance computing resources for scientific research.

Under the mentorship of a Chief Science Information Officer (CSIO) and with guidance from members of the Scientific Advisory Committee, participant activities will include: coordinate the development, planning, and assessment of scientific computing, AI, and data science workshops and trainings, coordinate activities and synthesize results by BDI fellows, learn how to produce a scientific newsletter for the BDI, and how to create and update material on a website, and develop, create, and evaluate surveys of training needs.
Learning Objectives: The participant will learn about a wide range of activities related to organizational and operational planning, training coordination, and science communication activities in support of the BDI and the ARS Ai Center of Excellence (AI COE). The participant will also have the opportunity to take on-line courses in scientific topics, such as R, Python and statistics, and to learn collaboration and leadership skills through workshop and working group experience.
USDA-ARS Contact: If you have questions about the nature of the research please contact Debra Peters (deb.peters@usda.gov).
Anticipated Appointment Start Date: Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.
Appointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year, but may be renewed upon recommendation of ARS and is contingent on the availability of funds.
Level of Participation: The appointment is full-time.
Participant Stipend: The participant(s) will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience.
Citizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents (LPR), and foreign nationals. Non-U.S. citizen applicants should refer to the Guidelines for Non-U.S. Citizens Details page of the program website for information about the valid immigration statuses that are acceptable for program participation.

Description
In 2016, residential and commercial buildings consumed more than 40 percent of the Nationâ€™s total energy and more than 74 percent of the electrical energy, resulting in an estimated annual national energy bill totaling more than $380 billion. Widespread adoption of existing energy-efficiency (EE) building technologies â€“ and the introduction and use of new technologies â€“ could eventually reduce energy use in homes and commercial buildings by 50 percent. This would save almost $200 billion annually on energy bills and help create jobs. BTOâ€™s mission is to support research and development (R&D), validation, and integration of affordable, energy-saving technologies, strategies, analytical tools, and information services to enable industry and others to deploy these at scale to reduce energy use and cost in both new and existing residential and commercial buildings.
In addition to EE, Buildings Technologies Office (BTO) has several additional co-emphases. An important one is demand-flexibility (DF), a buildingâ€™s ability to responsively shape its electricity draw at time scales ranging from multiple hours to seconds and even sub-seconds in order to support grid stability, reliability, and the efficient use of a variety of generation resources. Grid-interactive Efficient Buildings (GEB) is a cross-cutting BTO initiative aimed at establishing building-based DF as a key grid asset. Other emerging co-emphases include resilience, embodied energy, EE and DF at the neighborhood scale, and a new focus on technologies and strategies that support the building construction and deep renovation process; the latter is led by the Advanced Building Construction (ABC) initiative.
BTOâ€™s Emerging Technologies (ET) Program aims to enable the development of cost-effective technologies that can reduce building energy use intensity by 45 percent by 2030, relative to 2010 EE technologies. The ET Program works towards this goal by supporting early-stage R&D in component technologies for heating, ventilation, air-conditioning, and refrigeration (HVAC&R) and water heating; solid-state lighting; and windows and opaque building envelope. The ET Program also has sub-programs in integration technology areas including Sensors and Controls (S&C).
Machine learning (ML) and data science (DS) are playing increasingly large roles in many sectors and are beginning to make an impact in buildings sectors as well with applications in building control, grid response, equipment and system-level fault detection and diagnostics, measurement and verification (M&V), demand forecasting, planning, and others. BTOâ€™s ET Program seeks a talented and committed individual to help it enhance and expand its use of machine learning and data science throughout its portfolio.
Through this appointment, you will learn how to:
Participate in technical reviews/assessments of proposed research and development plans, conduct technical and economic feasibility analysis, as well as evaluate at a deep technical level the progress and ongoing viability and success potential of projects toward meeting the BTO energy efficiency goals. This includes periodic technical reviews and providing rigorous technical feedback for funded R&D projects; as well as collaborating in the negotiation of statements of work and project management plans with technically rigorous milestones, go/no-go decision points, stage-gates and deliverables for new awards.
Collaborate with BTO staff in the assessment of the state-of-the-art scientific literature and practice in machine learning and data science in building applications and in evaluating the potential of machine learning and data science in various building applications.
Collaborate with BTO staff in developing short, medium, and long term strategies and goals for the use of machine learning and data science in building applications.
Engage integration of BTOâ€™s machine learning and data science activities with other efforts across EERE, DOE, and with external stakeholders.

Selected participants will receive a stipend as support for their living and other expenses during this appointment. Stipend rates are determined by EERE officials and are based on the candidateâ€™s academic and professional background. Relocation expenses, not to exceed $5,000, incurred in relocating from the participant's current address to Washington, D.C. (if more than 50 miles from the address shown on the application), may be reimbursed. Participants will receive a travel allowance of $10,000 per appointment year to cover travel-related expenses to scientific and professional development activities.
This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents. (LPR).

 At Synctera, we're closing the gap between community banks and FinTechs. Empowering the fastest growing, secure, and scalable FinTech-As-A-Service (FaaS) platform, we tear down integration complexity and build bridges. There are too many FinTechs that need access to a sponsor bank and too few sponsor banks with which to partner, leading to a lack of pricing transparency and less than favorable pricing terms. We're here to help change that by guiding all parties through the onboarding process and beyond.

We are looking for interesting, wickedly smart people who are ready to jump in and run with our fast-growing team. If you want to have fun at work again, collaborate with some of the sharpest people in the industry, understand the bank - FinTech ecosystem, and love to win, read on! Who you are

First, you're a full stack data person. You know the perils of CSV formats and you've had to rinse and clean more than your fair share of data. You're fluent in SQL, Data Visualization and Dashboarding. You know that all data is uncertain and there is measurement error in everything. You love to learn. You thrive by helping companies become faster, better-informed and more confident in their data-driven decisions.

Analytics first, so we know the characteristics of the data we have on hand; and science next, for experiments and discoveries within those datasets.
What you'll do

This is the first hire in our team. Working across a variety of problem spaces, you'll bring understanding to our data - measuring how it's behaving and how our products are performing. From that platform, you'll start developing quantitative knowledge in our ecosystem. Your work will inform almost every aspect of our business, and will be visible throughout our community. It will give our customers and partners unprecedented visibility into their portfolios on our platform.

As our team grows, you'll mentor the folk who come after you. You'll continue to help our internal stakeholders understand and use the results of your analysis and experimentation to better inform our business decisions.
What you'll bring

Bachelor's degree (or equivalent experience) in relevant discipline - Statistics, Mathematics, a Science Degree or a Computer Science specialization. My favorite ex colleague had a Chemistry degree
Expertise in Python/Pandas/SciPy, R (or similar); strong SQL
Deep experience with one or more data Visualization tools - we use Looker, but Tableau, Matplotlib or Mode are all relevant alternatives. You'll have designed dashboards for many different internal stakeholders
5-10 years' experience of increasing responsibility, autonomy and influence
Experience being part of a small team being built from the ground up
Ability to think through problems and develop solutions quickly as a phenomenal problem solver
Solid technical background; experience with working on systems that process imperfect data
Results-oriented; someone who knows how to get the job done regardless of circumstance

What's a plus

Experience working in Agile development environments
Experience building a team from the ground up
Startup/Very small company experience
Solid understanding of banking and payments
Experience with one or more ELT/ETL tools
Experience with Gitlab and wireframing tools such as Balsamiq or LucidChart
