Description
The Extremity Trauma and Amputation Center of Excellence (EACE) is the leading advocate for research and treatment of Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) patients with extremity trauma and amputation. The EACE leads efforts to enhance collaboration between the DoD and the VA extremity trauma and amputation care providers and conduct scientific research to minimize the effects of traumatic injuries and improve clinical outcomes (https://www.health.mil/About-MHS/OASDHA/HSPO/EACE). This research fellowship will be housed jointly between the Naval Medical Center San Diego (NMCSD) and the University of California - San Diego (UCSD).
Research will focus on large-scale, longitudinal analyses of health outcomes following limb trauma and amputation in the military. Data elements are diverse, including electronic health records, walking mechanics, and health/wellness surveys measured before and after injury over the course of physical rehabilitation. The candidate will focus on the initial project phase, to include development of an efficient framework for data extraction, reduction, and organization. This work will inform subsequent aims of applied machine learning to select, train, and validate models for prediction of health and function in persons with limb trauma and amputation. The candidate will be provided hands-on, collaborative experience to take an early-stage project from initiation to analysis to knowledge product generation in a short period of time with high return on investment. The candidate will also have the opportunity to contribute to grant submissions to add to their knowledge of pursuing funding and becoming an independent researcher.

The tech is multi-patented, AI-powered, market-leading customer data management software that we invented because there was no way to solve the problems that we wanted to help consumer brands overcome. The opportunity is twofold: a market opportunity to provide a solution that consumer brands have been trying to find for decades, and a personal opportunity to grow and learn and hitch your career to a rocket ship.

Since our founding in 2016, Amperity has been growing 2.5X year-over-year. We've raised $187M in funding, including a recent Series D that put our valuation over one billion dollars. We're going places, fast, and we want you to come with us.

We support more S&P 500 consumer brands than any other data management platform. We help these brands make sense of massive amounts of transaction and engagement data so that they can finally know who their customers are, what opportunities exist, and how to provide the kinds of experiences that delight consumers and move the business metrics that matter. Our customers include Starbucks, Alaska Airlines, Patagonia, Kroger, J. Crew, Brooks Running, Planet Fitness, DICK's Sporting Goods, and many more.

We're building something that's never existed before, and we're doing it in a way that's great for consumers, transformational for our customers, and career-making for the members of the Amperity team. Come help us make it happen!
The Team

The data science team at Amperity is a close-knit community of engineers and data scientists that move quickly and rely on each other to think independently, work autonomously, handle ambiguity, and solve hard problems. We identify, design and implement algorithms that lie at the heart of our products:

Identity matching: deduplicating and clustering billions of records to their underlying identities daily. Our customers use our predictions to analyze their customer base and create a personalized experience for their customers at every touchpoint.
Predictive modeling: With unified and enriched customer profiles (thanks to our identity matching pipeline), we build advanced customer-centric models to predict metrics/behaviors such as customer lifetime value, product recommendations, discount sensitivity, and event propensity.

In addition to algorithmic development, we value sharing our findings with the broader data science community. We publish our research in top-tier peer-reviewed publications, engage with fellow data scientists by speaking at internal and external conferences, and also hold several patents focused on our core IP (with many more to come).

We're looking for a Senior Machine Learning Engineer to join our rapidly growing data science team to help develop and engineer state-of-the-art machine learning pipelines. As an integral part of our squad, you will collaborate with data scientists, product managers, and software engineers in prototyping and productizing predictive models that help our customers understand their customers and execute a smarter, more informed business strategy.
What You'll Do

Prototype new ML approaches for predictive modeling pipelines that help us understand complex user behaviors and preferences
Manage and innovate our ML ops infrastructure, helping us capture, track, and report metrics about our predictive output
Develop and maintain our data science stack, including integrations with pyspark, databricks, MLFlow, and Amperity's own software application
Be part of an active (and fun) group of machine learning practitioners and data scientists distributed across New York and Seattle
Contribute to new IP in the form of patents, research papers, conference presentations

About You

Undergraduate degree in a quantitative discipline (e.g. computer science, mathematics) with 2+ years of ML software development experience
Hands-on experience implementing production machine learning systems at scale in Scala, Python, Java, R, or similar languages. Experience with tools like Spark MLlib, MLFlow, Scikit-learn, etc. is a strong plus
Strong background in a broad set of ML concepts ranging from regression to clustering, along with model prototyping, tuning, and evaluation
Familiarity with distributed computation and specifically Apache Spark; comfortable with evaluating, optimizing, and debugging Spark applications
Ability to synthesize complex ideas for both technical and non-technical audiences. Good communication skills in conducting code reviews, writing technical documentation, and giving internal and external presentations.

Benefits

We offer all the benefits you'd expect from a ""great place to work"": 100% employee healthcare coverage, unlimited vacation, flexible hours, and very intentional career development. (And yes, we also offer trendy snacks and drinks on tap.) Beyond the basics, we provide an inclusive environment where you'll be challenged to find and unlock your full potential. You'll find yourself in a team with many different backgrounds and perspectives, but we all share one thing in common: our drive to improve ourselves, each other, and our product to better serve our customers..",1
